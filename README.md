# Piccolino is done

Will not be building on this project anymore.
Idea was to build a webapp then transform to native app, just another todo app but entirestack built by me.

## Takeaways
- Learnt alot about mongo setup
- ExpressJs is fairly easy to get going with
- Security is not easy :D
- Found heroku hard to setup

## Did not do but value now
- Having swagger to document ur API would have been nice, working on a feature in front-end and trying to remember what endpoint did what was hard due to in-frequest working on the task etc

## Nextime 
- Build first webpart in React, then port to native
- Use Swagger/documentation for API
